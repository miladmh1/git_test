  <p>Curries are notorious for lengthy ingredient lists to achieve the richly spiced sauces and punchy flavours. And
    while we’d all love to be able to whip up a from-scratch Tikka Masala and Butter Chicken whenever the craving hits
    us, it’s simply not viable.

    So today, I’m sharing the best SIMPLE chicken curry that I know. This recipe is a Western style curry – it’s not a
    traditional Indian curry, Thai curry, nor any other cuisine. And here’s why you’re going to love it as much as I do:
  </p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Curry powder is the only spice you need  </li>
  <li>garlic</li>
  <li>ginger</li>
  <li>onion</li>
  <li>chicken broth</li>
  <li>chicken</li>
  <li>Peas</li>
  <li>Coriander</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to make it</h2>
<p>There’s nothing groundbreaking about how this chicken curry is made. The one key step is to fry off the curry powder. This brightens up the flavour of the spices + creates more golden bits on the base of the pan, and both of these things add more flavour into the curry sauce!

  So don’t skip this step. </p>

  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Sauté onion until lightly browned.

    </li>
    <li>Stir in garlic, curry powder, cinnamon, paprika, bay leaf, ginger, sugar, and salt. Continue stirring for 2 minutes.

    </li>
    <li>Add chicken pieces, tomato paste, yogurt, and coconut milk. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes.

    </li>
    <li>Remove bay leaf, and stir in lemon juice and cayenne pepper. Simmer 5 more minutes.

    </li>
    <li>Serve hot and enjoy!
