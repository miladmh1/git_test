    alt="Delicious!">
  <p>This is a risotto so good, it will make a grown man weep. A creamy, umami packed Mushroom Risotto fully loaded with
    garlicky, buttery mushrooms stirred through the risotto AND piled on top, it’s completely and utterly
    mouthwateringly delicious, can’t-stop-eating-it-good.

    This is a fully loaded mushroom recipe – there’s 750g / 1.5 lb mushrooms in this!
    It’s such a let down when you’re faced with a giant bowl of Mushroom Risotto, only to find you have to fish around
    desperately through piles of gluey rice to find a a few piddly bits of mushrooms.
    Let me also assure you there is no gluey rice in sight. Just creamy, silky, perfectly al dente risotto</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>French Shallots</li>
    <li>Parmesan</li>
    <li>Cream</li>
    <li>garlic</li>
    <li>wine</li>
    <li>butter</li>
    <li>broth</li>
    <li>risotto rice</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Golden mushrooms – Sauté the mushrooms first to make them beautifully golden (because golden mushrooms = more
      flavour than colourless mushrooms!). Do this in 2 batches, else the pot is too crowded and they go watery and stew
      instead of golden. Then remove from the pot.</li>
    <li>Sauté garlic and onion until the onion is cooked and the garlic smells amazing!</li>
    <li>Deglaze with wine and add risotto – Add wine and let it simmer rapidly until mostly evaporated. Then add the
      risotto rice and stir so it gets coated in the butter and becomes semi-translucent – about 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add stock 1 1/2 cups at a time – We’re using a total of 5 cups of chicken stock which is the amount needed to
      cook 1 1/4 cups risotto rice so it’s al dente (cooked through but not mushy) with enough sauce so the risotto is
      beautifully creamy, as pictured.

      Add the stock 1 1/2 cups at a time, stir briefly then leave it for 3 minutes until the rice absorbs most of the
      liquid. Repeat 3 more times until the stock is used up, stirring regularly towards the end so the base doesn’t
      catch.</li>
    <li>Add cream and parmesan – Once the chicken stock is all used up and the rice is just cooked (about 12 minutes),
      the risotto will still seem a little sloppy which is exactly what we want. The excess liquid will evaporate quite
      rapidly in the finishing steps.

      Add the cream and parmesan, then give it a vigorous stir. This activates the starch in the risotto rice which
      gives the sauce the signature creamy consistency. In this step, you’ll also observe that the risotto transforms
      from being sloppy to beautifully creamy!</li>
    <li>Creamy and white – Notice the difference in the colour and consistency in Step 6 (after cream and stirring)
      compared to step 5.

    </li>
    <li>Add most mushrooms – Now add most of the mushrooms into the risotto, reserving some for garnish. Adding the
      mushrooms at the end rather than cooking the rice with the rice preserves the beautiful golden colour of the
      mushrooms.

    </li>
    <li>Serve! Ladle the risotto into bowls and top with remaining mushrooms. Your goal is for the risotto to be
      beautifully creamy, it should ooze when ladled into bowls rather than piling up in a thick stodgy mound. If your
      risotto gets a bit thick, just add a splash of boiling water to loosen it up again.

      Garnish risotto with extra parmesan (essential in my world) and a little sprinkle of parsley for a touch of
      freshness, if desired.</li>
  </ol>
